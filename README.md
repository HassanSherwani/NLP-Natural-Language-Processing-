# NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken.<br>
The development of NLP applications is challenging because computers traditionally require humans to "speak" to them in a programming language that is precise, unambiguous and highly structured, or through a limited number of clearly enunciated voice commands. Human speech, however, is not always precise -- it is often ambiguous and the linguistic structure can depend on many complex variables, including slang, regional dialects and social context.
